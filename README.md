# CSI-Connect-Model-400SE
The CSI Connect Model 400SE is a device that allows the user to connect an IEEE drive to a Commodore 64/128/VIC through it's native serial port. No plug in interface is needed for the userport or cartridge port. This device seamlessly allows the use of IEEE devices as easy as using a native drive such as the Commodore 1541 disk drive.

The power supply needed to power this device is any wall adapter that provides between 7 - 25VDC with a 2.1mm barrel connector (center positive). These are easy to find and inexpensive, especially if you look in places like Goodwill or Value Village. Linksys routers used a compatible power supply and are easy to find.

Features of this board (besides those mentioned above) include the following:

- Compatible with all IEEE cables, including factory keyed Commodore cables
- Dual surface mounted LED to indicate IEEE active
- Optional vented case designed to protect the board and IEEE edge connector from damage and ESD (as it is recessed in the case)
- Heatsinked onboard power regulator
- Dual IEC ports for connection to computer and additional IEC devices
- Gold plated IEEE edge connector
